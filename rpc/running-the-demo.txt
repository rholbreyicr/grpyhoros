The thrift library is bundled here. Even so, you'd need to install libopenssl:

brew install openssl@1.1

which probably will be included later (?). The python client/server files are here in case you want to try that, as eg:

cd <python/demo/files>
python3 PythonClient.py

If you run the plugin, you'll notice that the server blocks Horos (spinning ball), which is something we need to fix.... although blocking is maybe not such a bad idea, at least initially. Perhaps we could have a dialog which prints client calls and allows the user to exit when required.

You'll need to run 'killall Horos' or similar at present to get out of the demo...

Some helpers for install name
=============================

I came across a few helpful links for things about install_name, so I thought I'd pass them on:
